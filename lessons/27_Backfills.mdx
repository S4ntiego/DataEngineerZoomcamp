# Backfills

Backfills help to recover data or run queries in the specific interval of time from the past

Let's say that we've missed to run the pipeline in the first week of April, we can easily set the backfill functionality from the pipeline menu to run the pipeline for each day from 1st to 7th April like it was that time of the year again, so we can get the data from the past, which we would normally gather anyway, but we didn't because we have forgotten or there was an error, etc.
