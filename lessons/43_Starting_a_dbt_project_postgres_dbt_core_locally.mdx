# Starting a dbt project locally
1. Install dbt core with postgres adapter to be able to use the CLI, create .dbt folder and profiles.yml:
```terminal
python -m pip install dbt-core dbt-postgres
mkdir ~/.dbt
touch ~/.dbt/profiles.yml
```
2. Open the profiles.yml with VSCode and paste the following config, profiles define connection to different databases, like postgres, or bigquery. To use dbt with postgres and bigquery locally, we have to install different adapters, unlink the one that we don't need at the moment, and then link the one that we need and so on and so forth:
```yml profiles.yml
# pg-de-zoomcamp:
#   outputs:
#     dev:
#       dataset: dbt_adam_ksiazek
#       keyfile: ny-rides-adam-6deb3ca16f64.json
#       method: service-account
#       project: ny-rides-adam
#       threads: 4
#       type: bigquery
#   target: dev
taxi:
  outputs:
    dev:
      dbname: taxi
      host: localhost
      pass: root
      port: 5432
      schema: dbt_adam_ksiazek
      threads: 4
      type: postgres
      user: root
  target: dev
```
3. Create a new github repo, clone using terminal ```git clone <https>``` and open in VSCode
4. Run docker compose up to host pgAdmin and postgres locally, in pgAdmin create a new schema dbt_your_name
5. Run dbt init inside the cloned repository:
```code terminal
dbt init
```
name:taxi
enter a number: 1
the rest accordingly to the profiles.yml data

logs and taxi folders will be created in the given directory.

6. Move the dbt_project.yml to the main directory /ny_taxi_rides_zoomcamp, outside the newly created taxi folder
7. Run this command to check connection and potential errors:
```code terminal
dbt debug
```
