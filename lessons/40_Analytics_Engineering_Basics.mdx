# Tooling
- Data Loading: Airflow, Mage, SSIS
- Data Storing: Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift/Databricks
- Data Modelling: dbt/Dataform
- Data Presentation: Tableau, Looker, PowerBi, Google Data Studio

# ETL vs ELT
ETL: more stable and compliant, higher storage and compute costs
ELT: faster and more flexible, lower cost and lower maintenance

# Kimball's Dimensional Modelling
Objective: 
- Deliver data understandable to the business users

- measurements, metrics, facts
- correspons to a business process
- verbs (czasowniki in Polish)

Dimensions:

- nouns (rzeczowniki in Polish)

# Architecture of Dimensional Modeling
Stage area (Ingredients, give them to cookers):
- contains raw data
- not means to be exposed to everyone, only to people who will know how to process raw data into data models

Processing area (Cookers): 
- from raw data to data models
- focuses in efficiency
- ensuring standards

Presentation area (Guests at the restaurant, enjoying our meal):
- exposure to business stakeholder
