# GitHub Codespaces
Code anywhere using a web-based editor or preferred IDE (like VSC).
It is not an equivalent of a Virtual Machine, but rather a containerized development environment based on Visual Studio Code.
Additional tools can be installed, but with some limitations.

# Create new repository and codespace
https://github.com/new -> Create new repository with a README file

https://github.com/codespaces -> New codespace
Repository: AdamZoomcamp2024 (the one created a few seconds ago)
Branch: main
Region: Europe West
Machine type: 2-core

# Run Codespace in local VSCode Desktop
Click 3 lines in the left top corner -> Open in VS Code Desktop -> Install Extension and Open URI -> Sign In

# Test Codespace
We already have Python installed with several libraries available for us thanks to the Codespace environment:

```code vscode terminal
python --version
pip list
```

# Install Terraform and Jupyter Notebook
Find the download link for Terraform (Ubuntu/Debian Package manager):
```code vscode terminal
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform
terraform --version
pip install jupyter
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
jupyter notebook
```

Copy 127.0.0.1:8888 link and paste in the browser.

You can use ctrl + c in the vscode terminal to close jupyter connection.

# Create Docker network
We can also run Docker:
```code terminal
docker network create pg-network
docker volume create --name dtc_postgres_volume_local -d local
```

Docker volume creates a new directory on Codespaces VM with the name dtc_postgres_volume_local and through using -d, it stores the volume data on the host filesystem, so in Codespace VM's system (typically under /var/lib/docker/volumes/).

Docker volume can be then mounted to, eg. postgres instance and any data written by the container will end up in this repository (Codespaces are ephemeral environments and thus the data won't survive the termination of the VC unless using additional steps, such as a remote volume driver).

# Run Docker container with Postgres instance
```code terminal
docker run -it \
-e POSTGRES_USER='root' \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD='root' \
-e POSTGRES_DB='taxi' \
-v dtc_postgres_volume_local:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
-p 5432:5432 \
--network=pg-network \
--name=pg-database \
postgres:13
```

# Run Docker container with pgAdmin instance
Open up new terminal and run:
```code terminal
docker run -it \
-e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL='admin@admin.com' \
-e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD='root' \
-p 8080:80 \
--network=pg-network \
--name=pg-admin \
dpage/pgadmin4
```

pgAdmin is now available under localhost:8080 in the browser.

# Commit changes to online Codespace from local VSCode
Open Source Control -> Click on '+' to stage all changes (staging is like selecting files for the next commit, it gives granular control over what will be commited and whatnot) -> Type Commit Message 'My first Jupyter Notebook' -> Commit -> Sync Changes (it will push commit to repo)

Check the commit in your github repository

# Connect pgAdmin to Postgres instance
http://localhost:8080/browser/ -> Add New Server -> Name: MyServer -> Connection -> 
Host name/address: pg-database
Username: root
Password: root

Useful commands:
/ pip list - list installed libraries/software
