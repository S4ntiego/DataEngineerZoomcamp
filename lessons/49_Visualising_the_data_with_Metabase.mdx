# Metabase
Metabase website: https://www.metabase.com/
If you want to create the dashboard for free. use the Docker version, but remember that you have to have your postgres instance online at the same time.

I wouldn't recommend using Metabase as of 2024, because there are better, more widely used alternatives such as:
- Power BI (Microsoft): Feature-rich with strong Microsoft Office integration, but requires a paid subscription.
- Looker (Google Cloud): Powerful and cloud-based, but also has a paid pricing model.
- Tableau (Salesforce): A leader in data visualization, with a free personal edition but paid plans for businesses.

# Metabase's Strengths:
Open-Source and Free: It's a cost-effective option for many businesses and individual projects.
User-Friendly: Designed for non-technical users to explore data and create visualizations.
Wide Integrations: Connects to various data sources, making setup easier.

# Potential Weaknesses:
Limited Features: Compared to advanced BI tools, Metabase might lack functionalities for complex data analysis.
Job Market: Very, very limited job listings (at least in Poland)
