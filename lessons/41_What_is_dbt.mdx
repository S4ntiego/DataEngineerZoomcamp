# What is dbt?

dbt is a transformation workflow that allows anyone that knows SQL to deploy analytics code following software engineering practices like modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation

With dbt we can transform Raw Data into Data Models in our Data Warehouse.

# How to use dbt?

There are 2 dbt concepts - dbt Core and dbt Cloud

dbt Core is free and open source, it builds and runs a dbt project (.sql and .yml), includes SQL compilaiton logic, macros and database adapters and includes a CLI interface to run dbt commands locally

dbt Cloud is a SASS, a web-based IDE to run and test a dbt project, it runs dbt Core under the hood, but has so much more functionality, like jobs orchestration, logging, managed environments, admin and metadata API, semantic layer, and integrated documentation
