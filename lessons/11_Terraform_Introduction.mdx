# Terraform
Why Terraform?
- Simplicity in keeping track of infrastructure (Types of storage, disks capacity, etc.)
- Easier collaboration (Terraform files an be uploaded to eg. Github)
- Reproducibility (In case you need to clone the infrastructure, or prepare something similar)
- Ensure resources are removed (As resources are very expensive, it can be done with a command)

What is Terraform?
- Infrastructure as code 

What Terraform is not?
- Does not manage and update code on Infrastructure (It is not made for deploying/updating software)
- Does not give the ability to change immutable resources (You can't change virtual machine type, because that would be destructive, change cloud storage localization, etc.)
- Not used to manage resources defined beyond terraform files (like kubernetes cluster)

Terraform lives inside the Local Machine/Virtual Machine and communicates with the Cloud (GCP/Azure/AWS, etc.) through the Provider (like GCP Provider)

There is also the need to authorize the access, it can be through the access token, service account, and many others

Providers
- Code that allows terraform to communicate to manage resources on (cloud) platforms

Key Terraform Commands:
/ Init - get the providers I need, get the resources/code from the cloud to local machine
/ Plan - show resources that will be created (What am I about to do?)
/ Apply - go out and build that infrastructure, do what is in the terraform files
/ Destroy - remove everything defined in the terraform files
