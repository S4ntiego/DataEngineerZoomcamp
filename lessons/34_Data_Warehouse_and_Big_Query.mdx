# BigQuery, OLTP vs OLAP

OLTP - Online Transaction Processing
OLAP - Online Analytical Processing

*OLTP* - essential business operations in real time, short and fast updates initiated by the user, normalized databases for efficiency (foreign keys in main table related to primary keys in dimensional tables, like brand id, brand id brand name), customer-facing personnel, online shoppers, small space requirements if historical data is archived, regular backups required, lists day-to-day transactions

*OLAP* - denormalized data, brand name can be stored in the same table and contain duplicated data, analytical purposes, large datasets, data periodically refreshed through jobs, purpose to plan, solve problems, discover hidden insights, multi-dimensional view of enterprise data, data analysts, business analysts, executives use this data, lost data can be reloaded from OLTP database

data warehouse - olap solution, used for reporting and data analysis, consists of meta data, raw data and summary data, data from data warehouse may be then stored in different data marts for different purposes, purchasing, sales, inventory, etc.

*BigQuery* - serverless data warehouse, software as well as infrastructure included, build-in features like:
- machine learning
- geospatial analysis
- business intelligence
It separates the compute engine that analyzes the data from the storage

BigQuery contains some publicly available datasets in the bigquery-public-data catalog, like new york citibike data that gathers data starting from 2013:
```sql
SELECT station_id, name
FROM bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_stations
LIMIT 100;
```

# External table from a gcs file (parquet, csv, etc)

We can also create external table referring to gcs path, ny-rides-adam refers to the project in bigquery, ny_taxi to dataset in bigquery, and external_taxi to new table name. uris refer to project and location of the file on the google cloud storage drive:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `ny-rides-adam.ny_taxi.external_taxi`
OPTIONS (
  format = 'PARQUET',
  uris = ['gs://mage-zoomcamp-adam/taxi_parquet.parquet']
)
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM ny-rides-adam.ny_taxi.external_taxi
LIMIT 10;
```

# Partitions

We can also create a non partitioned table from external table:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ny-rides-adam.ny_taxi.external_taxi_non_partitioned AS
SELECT * FROM ny-rides-adam.ny_taxi.external_taxi
```

And a partitioned table (eg. by the the date extracted from tpep_pickup_datetime):
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ny-rides-adam.ny_taxi.external_taxi_partitioned 
PARTITION BY 
DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) AS
SELECT * FROM ny-rides-adam.ny_taxi.external_taxi
```

Let's check the impact of partitioning:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(VendorID)
FROM ny-rides-adam.ny_taxi.external_taxi_partitioned 
WHERE DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-01-30' 
```

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(VendorID)
FROM ny-rides-adam.ny_taxi.external_taxi_non_partitioned 
WHERE DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-01-30' 
```

Let's look into partitions:
```sql
SELECT table_name, partition_id, total_rows
FROM ny_taxi.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
WHERE table_name='external_taxi_partitioned'
ORDER BY total_rows DESC
```

# Clusters

Let's create a partition and cluster table:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ny-rides-adam.ny_taxi.external_taxi_partitioned_clustered 
PARTITION BY 
DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) 
CLUSTER BY VendorID AS
SELECT * FROM ny-rides-adam.ny_taxi.external_taxi
```

Let's find the number of rides where VendorId is equal to 1:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS trips
FROM ny-rides-adam.ny_taxi.external_taxi_partitioned_clustered
WHERE 1=1
AND DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-01-30'
AND VendorID=1
```
