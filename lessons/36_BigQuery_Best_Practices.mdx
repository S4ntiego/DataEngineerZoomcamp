# Cost Reduction
- avoid SELECT *
- price queries before running them
- use partitioned/clustered tables
- use streaming inserts with caution
- materialize query results in stages

# Query performance
- filter on partitioned/clustered columns
- denormalize data (so that you can use less joins)
- use nested or repeated columns
- use external data sources appropriately
- reduce data before using a join
- do not treat WITH clasus as prepared statements
- avoid oversharding tables (shards are like partitions, don't create tables with too many of partitions if their size is relatively small, less than 1GB)
- don't use external data sources in case you want high query performance
- avoid JavaScript user-defined functions
- order last
- optimize join patterns
- place the table with the largest number of rows first, followed by the table with fewest rows, and then place the remaining tables by decreasing size
