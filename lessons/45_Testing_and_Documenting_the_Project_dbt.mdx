# Tests
- assumptions that we make about our data
- tests in dbt are essentialy a select sql query
- these assumptions get compiled to sql that returns the amount of failing records
- tests are defined on a column in the .yml file
- dbt provides basic tests to check if the columns values are:
    - unique
    - not null
    - accepted values
    - a foreign key to another table
- you can create your custom tests as queries

# Monthly revenue model

Create a *dm_monthly_zone_revenue.sql* datamart in the models/core folder and copy the content from the data engineering zoocamp repo https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/04-analytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny/models/core/dm_monthly_zone_revenue.sql:

```sql dm_monthly_zone_revenue.sql
{{ config(materialized='table') }}

with trips_data as (
    select * from {{ ref('fact_trips') }}
)
    select 
    -- Reveneue grouping 
    pickup_zone as revenue_zone,
    {{ dbt.date_trunc("month", "pickup_datetime") }} as revenue_month, 

    service_type, 

    -- Revenue calculation 
    sum(fare_amount) as revenue_monthly_fare,
    sum(extra) as revenue_monthly_extra,
    sum(mta_tax) as revenue_monthly_mta_tax,
    sum(tip_amount) as revenue_monthly_tip_amount,
    sum(tolls_amount) as revenue_monthly_tolls_amount,
    sum(ehail_fee) as revenue_monthly_ehail_fee,
    sum(improvement_surcharge) as revenue_monthly_improvement_surcharge,
    sum(total_amount) as revenue_monthly_total_amount,

    -- Additional calculations
    count(tripid) as total_monthly_trips,
    avg(passenger_count) as avg_monthly_passenger_count,
    avg(trip_distance) as avg_monthly_trip_distance

    from trips_data
    group by 1,2,3
```

dbt.date_trunc is a cross-database macro provided by dbt, so it will work even if we change the providers (postgres, oracle, bigquery, etc., these have different syntax for dates and so on):
https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/cross-database-macros

let's also add another package to *packages.yml* (https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/codegen/latest/):
```code packages.yml
 - package: dbt-labs/codegen
    version: 0.12.1
```
and run ```dbt deps```

Now, let's generate yaml for our models with codegen:
```code terminal
{% set models_to_generate = codegen.get_models(directory='staging', prefix='stg') %}
{{ codegen.generate_model_yaml(
    model_names = models_to_generate
) }}
```
It gave us yaml for all of the columns and datatypes, paste it into the schema.yml.

To tripid add the following tests:
```code schema.yml
tests:
          - unique:
              severity: warn
          - not_null:
              severity: warn
```

And these to dropoff and pickup locationid:
```code schema.yml
tests:
          - relationships:
              to: ref('taxi_zone_lookup')
              field: locationid
              severity: warn
```

to dbt_project.yml add the following variables shared between files in the project:
```code dbt_project.yml
vars:
  payment_type_values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

so we can use the same variable in the payment_type column tests like this, we need to add quote:false for bigquery, otherwise it will fail:
```code schema.yml
tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: "{{ var('payment_type_values') }}"
              severity: warn
              quote: false
```

Now, let's run dbt build to see how our build manages the tests:
```code terminal
dbt build
```

# Documentation
- dbt provides a way to generate documentation for your dbt project and render it as a website
- the documentation for your project includes:
    - information about the project:
        - model code (both from the .sql file and compiled)
        - model dependencies
        - sources
        - auto generated DAG from the red and source macros
        - descriptions (from the schema.yml file) and tests
    - information about the data warehouse (information_schema):
        - column names and data types
        - table stats like size and rows
- dbt docs can also be hosted in dbt cloud

You can describe all the columns in the schema.yml files! For our models, you can also copy schema.yml files from the zoomcamp repo: https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/04-analytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny/models

Remember to swap the tripdata words to taxi and to include your tables and schemas.

Now run the generation of the docs:
```code terminal
dbt docs generate
```
