# Starter project
Option A, CLI:
install dbt locally, setup the profiles.yml, run dbt init

Option B, dbt cloud:
set up dbt cloud credentials (repo and dwh), start from web-based IDE

Option A:
1. Clone the zoomcamp github repository
2. Set up dbt account, connect the dbt with the google cloud json key
3. Connect with the newly cloned github repo
4. Edit the default, 'analytics' project, change project name to 'taxi', and project subdirectory to 04-anaytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny to include only the related folder from the whole repo
5. On the navbar click the Develop -> Cloud IDE
6. Create new branch 'de-zoomcamp-videos'
7. Delete the taxi_rides_ny folder from the repo and commit stages (commit and sync -> "delete")
8. Initialize dbt project, then go to 'dbt_project.yml' file
9. Change name to 'taxi' and swap 'my-new-project' to 'taxi' under models:, delete the example with materialized table, so the below fragment, because it adds materialization table to all models:
```code
 # Applies to all files under models/example/
    example:
      +materialized: table
```
10. Run dbt build command at the bottom:
```code
dbt build
```
11. Commit changes 'init my dbt project'
