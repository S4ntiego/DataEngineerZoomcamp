New Project -> "terraform-demo" -> create -> Switch to "terraform-demo" project ->
IAM and admin -> Service accounts -> + create service account -> Service account name: terraform-runner -> CREATE AND CONTINUE -> Select a role -> 
- Cloud Storage / Storage Admin (in real life we would only need bucket creator and ability to destroy buckets)
- BigQuery / BigQuery Admin (in real life we would need to be able to create and destroy the dataset) 
-> CONTINUE -> DONE

IAM -> Service Account -> Edit principal -> + ADD ANOTHER ROLE -> 
- Compute Engine / Compute Admin ()
-> SAVE

Service Accounts -> Actions -> Manage Keys -> ADD KEY -> Create new key -> JSON

!UNAUTHORIZED PEOPLE CAN'T SEE THESE CREDENTIALS, WITH SUCH BROAD ROLES TERRIBLE THINGS LIKE MINING BITCOINS, UPLOADING ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF FILES, AND MANY OTHERS CAN HAPPEN!

```code terminal
mkdir terrademo
cd terrademo
mkdir keys
cd keys
nano my-creds.json
```

Open up and copy everything from the previously generated json key and pass it to the nano editor (right click -> paste) -> ctrl+x

Open up Visual Studio Code in the terrademo directory -> Install HashiCorp Terraform extension

Google Provider: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs
Project (Project ID): https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard
GCP Regions: https://cloud.google.com/about/locations#europe

Create main.tf file and paste this provider:
```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "5.29.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "google" {
  #hard coding credentials is not the best idea
  #you can also use the gcloud default auth-login command if you have google sdk to get a link to login
  #or you can type pwd to get the current directory and then export credentials with another command like this: ```export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS='/Users/adamksiazek/terrademo/keys/my-creds.json'```
  credentials="./keys/my-creds.json"
  project = "terraform-demo-423412"
  region  = "europe-west1"
}
```

```code
terraform init
```
Terraform Google Storage Bucket: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/storage_bucket
Google Cloud Dashboard -> Cloud Storage -> Buckets

```terraform
resource "google_storage_bucket" "demo-bucket" {
  #it has to be unique across the whole GCP (so we can use our projectID for example)!!
  name          = "terraform-demo-423412-terra-bucket"
  location      = "EU"
  force_destroy = true

  lifecycle_rule {
    condition {
      #in days
      age = 1
    }
    action {
      #if the upload action a very big file that was split into chunks wasn't completed during one day - abort the upload
      type = "AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload"
    }
  }
}
```

```code
terraform plan
```

```code
terraform apply
```

```code
terraform destroy
```

!In case of pushing terraform code to GitHub it is very important to include .gitignore file (google terraform gitignore)!

```code .gitignore
# Local .terraform directories
**/.terraform/*

# .tfstate files
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*

# Crash log files
crash.log
crash.*.log

# Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sensitive data, such as
# password, private keys, and other secrets. These should not be part of version 
# control as they are data points which are potentially sensitive and subject 
# to change depending on the environment.
*.tfvars
*.tfvars.json

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# Include override files you do wish to add to version control using negated pattern
# !example_override.tf

# Include tfplan files to ignore the plan output of command: terraform plan -out=tfplan
# example: *tfplan*

# Ignore CLI configuration files
.terraformrc
terraform.rc

# .json files with keys
*.json
```

Helpful commands:
/mkdir *folder name* - makes a new folder in the current directory (terminal)
/cd *folder_name* - goes to the folder (terminal)
/nano *file name* - opens up nano file editor (terminal)
/ctrl+o - save file and continue editing (nano)
/ctrl+x - save file and exit (nano)
/cd .. - go one directory back (terminal)
/shift+cmd+n - opens up new instance of the given program (mac)
/terraform fmt - format terraform file, line, etc (vsc)
/echo $GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS - test previously exported credentials
