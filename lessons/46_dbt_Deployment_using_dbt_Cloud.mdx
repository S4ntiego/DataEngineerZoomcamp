# What is deployment
- process of running the models we created in our development environment in a production environment
- development and later deployment allows to continue building models and testing them without affecting the production environment
- a deployment environment will normally have a different schema in the data warehouse and ideally a different user
- a development - deployment workflow resemble these steps:
    - develop in user branch
    - open a pull request to merge into the main branch
    - merge the user dev branch to the main branch
    - run the new models in the production environment using the main branch
    - schedule the models

# Production deployment
dbt Cloud dashboard:
1) Commit all the changes -> Make a pull request -> Merge dev branch with main branch -> go to Deploy in the navbar -> Environments -> + Create Environment -> Environment name: Production, Dataset: taxi_prod -> Save -> Create a taxi_prod dataset in the bigquery

2) Deploy -> Jobs -> + Create job -> Deploy job -> Job name: nightly, Description: This is where the data hits the production, change command to ```code dbt build --vars '{'is_test_run': false}'``` Generate docs on run, Run source freshness, Run on schedule (Intervals/Every 12 hours/Without sunday) -> Save -> Run now

3) Settings -> Account Settings -> Projects -> taxi -> Edit -> Documentation -> Nightly -> Source freshness -> Nightly -> Save

4) Deploy -> Jobs -> + Create Job -> Continuous integration job -> Job name: CI checks, Description: Avoid breaking production, in Execution settings we could add commands like ```dbt test documented_models```, which would check if all models are documented and so on and so forth, default command is: ```dbt build --select state:modified+```, which means run anything that was modified and its children, or we can run tests only, etc.


API trigger is useful to trigger the deployment via something like the Airflow, Mage, Dagster, Prefect, etc.

Running a dbt project in production:
- dbt cloud includes a scheduler where to create jobs to run in production
- a single job can run multiple commands
- jobs can be triggered manually or on schedule
- each job will keep a log of the runs over time
- each run will have the logs for each command
- a job could also generate documentation, that could be viewed under the run information
- if dbt source freshness was run, the results can also be viewed at the end of a job

# What is Continuous Integration (CI)
- CI is the practice of regularly merge development branches into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run
- the goal is to reduce adding bugs to the production code and maintain a more stable project
- dbt allows us to enable CI on pull requests
- enabled via webhooks from GitHub or GitLab
- when a PR is ready to be merged, a webhooks is received in dbt Cloud that will enqueue a new run of the specified job
- the run of the CI job will be against a temporary schema
- no PR will be able to be merged unless the run has been completed successfully
