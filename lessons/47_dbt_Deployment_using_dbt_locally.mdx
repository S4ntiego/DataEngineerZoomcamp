In order to deploy to production using the dbt locally, let's make another, prod, profile in the *profiles.yml* file located in the root/.dbt directory:
```yml profiles.yml
taxi:
  # by default dbt build will target dev, dbt build -t prod will target prod
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      dbname: taxi
      host: localhost
      pass: root
      port: 5432
      schema: dbt_adam_ksiazek
      threads: 4
      type: postgres
      user: root
    prod:
      dbname: production
      host: localhost
      pass: root
      port: 5432
      schema: master
      threads: 4
      type: postgres
      user: root
```

Then, we need to target this profile while building the dbt project:
```code terminal
dbt build -t prod
```

We can then schedule this command to run daily, weekly, etc, with tools like Dagster, Airflow, or with a CRON job.
